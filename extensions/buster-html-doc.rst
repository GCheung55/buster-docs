``buster-html-doc`` is an extension that implements "markup-in-comments",
using the ``/*:DOC el = ... */`` format originally found in JsTestDriver.
The extension was originally developed to be API compatible with JsTestDriver
in the ``buster-jstestdriver`` extension, but works well with vanilla
Buster.JS test cases (and specs) too.
