``buster-coffee`` is an extension that automatically compile CoffeeScript
files before running tests. In its current state, this extension does not work
for files that are to be included using ``require()``, and is thus not very
useful for Node.js projects. Currently developed by 
`Stein Magnus Jodal <https://github.com/jodal/buster-coffee>`_.

* Status: Stable, but future changes may be required to support Node.js and ``require()``
* `Source code <https://github.com/jodal/buster-coffee>`_
